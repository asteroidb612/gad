#Welcome! This is a React client for https://debatemap.app.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

#Design and workflow principles:

- Mobile first
- Github workflow (create feature/cool-new-branch-name, push, review, merge)

#Recommended plugins and environment settings:

- SPACES 4 LIFE (2 of them). See next point to not worry about this.
- For code uniformity, please install the Prettier extension for your code editor.

#Getting started

First, you will need to reate a .env file. See the included .env.example. You should be able to make a renamed copy of this
and be good to go.

Then you can:

```
npm install
npm start
```
